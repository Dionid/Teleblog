# FAQ

## Why some posts are separated and some merged?

Every photo, video, audio, file, poll, etc. is a separate post in TG.

To merge them toghether, we use `album_id` field.

But there is no `album_id` for messages parsed from history.

So right now the only way is to assume that messages that are created in the same time are from the same album.
